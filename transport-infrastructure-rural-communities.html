        <h2>Transport Infrastructure in Rural Communities</h2>
        <p>
            The UK Government is committing £1.6 billion to improve local roads, particularly in rural areas, as part of a broader £6 billion strategy aimed at addressing issues like potholes. Local MP Ben Goldsborough has highlighted the urgent need for upgrades to the Thickthorn junction in Norfolk, which he believes is essential for supporting economic growth and new housing developments. He is calling for government backing and a ministerial visit to underscore the project's significance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to road improvements, the government has approved upgrades to four major road projects across England, with the Thickthorn junction being a focal point among these investments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accessibility issues at Sleaford's grade II listed railway station have also come under scrutiny. Dr. Caroline Johnson, MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, has raised concerns about the lack of a lift, which restricts access for individuals with disabilities. She has campaigned for a lift, collaborating with East Midlands Railway and securing funding from the previous government. Similarly, MP Lilian Greenwood is advocating for a lift at a heritage railway station, having also worked with East Midlands Railway to obtain funding for a feasibility study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both MPs are urging the current government to prioritize accessibility improvements in railway services. The Rail Minister has expressed willingness to discuss proposals aimed at enhancing facilities, reflecting a commitment to making transport more inclusive for all passengers, particularly those with mobility challenges.
