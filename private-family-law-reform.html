        <h2>Reform of Private Family Law Hearings</h2>
        <p>
            Dr. Neil Shastri-Hurst has called for significant reforms in the family law system to better protect the emotional and psychological wellbeing of children affected by divorce. He criticizes the current court processes, which often exacerbate children's distress during child arrangement orders, with over 16,000 open cases impacting nearly 26,000 children and an average resolution time of 44 weeks. Shastri-Hurst argues for the abolition of magistrates in private law children's cases, citing their lack of formal legal qualifications compared to district judges, which can lead to inconsistent and potentially harmful decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            He advocates for all family law matters to be overseen by specialized family judges and suggests the establishment of expert panels that include child psychology professionals to enhance decision-making. This approach aims to ensure that children's best interests are prioritized in legal proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
            In response, supporters of the current system highlight that family magistrates, despite their lack of formal qualifications, receive extensive training from the Judicial College and have been integral to family proceedings since before the family court's establishment in 2014. They emphasize that magistrates play a crucial role in fair decision-making, particularly regarding child arrangements, and are supported by legal advisers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The family justice system is currently grappling with challenges, including a rise in outstanding cases and an average resolution time of 47 weeks in 2023. The government is focused on reforming private family law, enhancing support for domestic abuse survivors, and ensuring that children's voices are heard in legal proceedings.
