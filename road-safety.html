        <h2>Road Safety</h2>
        <p>
            Concerns over road safety have intensified, with Olivia Bailey highlighting a stagnation in progress since the Conservative government took office. While the last Labour government halved road fatalities, the current administration has only achieved a 12% reduction in road deaths and serious injuries from 2010 to 2023, impacting nearly 30,000 individuals. In the past year alone, 000 people were killed or seriously injured on roads, averaging one casualty every 18 minutes. Bailey is advocating for a new road safety strategy, the first in a decade, with details expected soon.

            Bailey has also received nearly 400 complaints from constituents regarding the dangerous slip roads at East Ilsley and Beedon on the A34. One resident, Nick, expressed fears for his family's safety at the Beedon junction, prompting Bailey to seek a meeting with the Minister and National Highways for improvements. Lilian Greenwood supports Bailey's efforts for safer roads, noting that National Highways had previously conducted safety studies and enhancements at East Ilsley in 2019.

            Additionally, concerns have been raised about an unusable bus stop at Bridgwater railway station, which has remained inoperable due to road layout issues. Sir Ashley Fox criticized Somerset council for not addressing this minor fix, while Greenwood acknowledged it as a local council matter but emphasized the government's readiness to assist. The overarching goal is to enhance road safety and connectivity in the constituency, underscoring the need for government involvement in local transport issues.
